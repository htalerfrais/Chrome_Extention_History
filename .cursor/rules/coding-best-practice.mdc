1. **DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**  
   - Always avoid code duplication.  
   - If a piece of code looks similar to existing logic, reuse or refactor.  

2. **Simplicity & Efficiency**  
   - Write only the necessary code.  
   - Prefer the simplest solution that works efficiently.  
   - Avoid over-engineering, unnecessary abstractions, or unused helpers.  
   - Do not write code that is not going to be user yet.

3. **Consistency with Existing Codebase**  
   - Before implementing something new, compare your approach with how similar components/features are coded in the existing app.  
   - If your method differs from the existing one:  
     - **Do not apply it directly.**  
     - **Warn me** and wait for my confirmation before proceeding.  

4. **Communication**
   - Do not hesitate to warn me whenever you find code that doesn't respect best practices, or is useless, while you are reading the codebase.
