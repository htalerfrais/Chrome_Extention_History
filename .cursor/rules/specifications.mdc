📌 Version V0.2 — IN PROGRESS 🚧

🎯 Goal

Enhance the extension so that the browsing history is organized into sessions, processed into thematic clusters, and displayed in a dedicated dashboard page inside the extension.

This removes the need to keep multiple tabs open by giving the user a structured overview of their past browsing.

🔑 Features Implemented

✅ Backend Minimal NLP (Python + FastAPI + Docker)
- Accepts browsing history data from the extension
- Basic session grouping (time-based segmentation)
- Basic clustering method to extract browsing themes/topics
- Returns structured results as JSON groups
- Runs locally via Docker (deployable to cloud)

✅ Extension ↔ Backend Communication
- Extension sends session data to backend API (localhost:8000)
- Receives JSON response with thematic groups
- API URL abstracted for dev/production switching

✅ Dedicated Dashboard Page (dashboard.html)
- Separate extension page (not popup)
- Ultra-clean UI showing only theme names and actual pages
- Minimal design: theme + browsing history items with favicons

📦 Remaining Tasks for V0.2

- [ ] Rework groupIntoSession for smarter session creation
- [ ] Rework clustering_service.py for simpler approach
  - Change theme detection to use proper NLP
  - Work on theme detection independently for each session
- [ ] Improve frontend design and user experience

🎨 Current State: Basic implementation with ultra-minimal dashboard. Core functionality works but needs refinement for better session grouping, smarter clustering, and improved UI.
